This is a zero-terminated sequence of char values that may contain different grouping sizes for each successive group starting from the right, each number indicating the amount of digits for the group; the last number before the ending zero in this string is used for the remaining groups. For example, assuming thousand_sep is set to "," and the number to represent is one million (1000000):
